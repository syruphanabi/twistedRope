'6': show main pipe | you see a big pipe
	's' and mouse drag to twist main pipe
	'u' and mouse drag to see natural path
	'f' automatically twist, so that both ends align with each other
'7': editing mode | you see braids, but they are ugly and cheap
'8': pre-twist test | one of the braids is twistable, test pre-twist under this mode
	's' and mouse drag to twist main pipe
	However, function of 'f' is not allowed here. 
'9': well-rendered mode | after edit the shape of main curve, switch to this mode to see the fine results


'0': 2 strand braids
'1': 3 strand braids
'2': 4 strand braids


'b': the method to compute control vectors of main polygon switch between V(A,C) and 3-circles
	default value is V(A,C). We find it better when number of vertices is not many.
